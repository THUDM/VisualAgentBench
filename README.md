# VisualAgentBench: Towards Large Multimodal Models as Visual Foundation Agents

**VisualAgentBench (VAB)** is the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and develop large multi models (LMMs) as visual foundation agents, which comprises 5 distinct environments across 3 types of representative visual agent tasks (Embodied, GUI, and Visual Design)

- VAB-OmniGibson (Embodied)
- VAB-Minecraft (Embodied)
- VAB-Mobile (GUI)
- VAB-WebArena-Lite (GUI, based on [WebArena](https://github.com/web-arena-x/webarena) and [VisualWebArena](https://github.com/web-arena-x/visualwebarena))
- VAB-CSS (Visual Design)

Compared to its predecessor [AgentBench](https://github.com/THUDM/AgentBench), VAB highlights visual inputs and the enabling of **Foundation Agent** capability development with training open LLMs/LMMs on trajectories.

## Quick Start

This section will first give you an overview to the use and architecture of VAB.
Next, it will guide you on how to use `gpt-4o-2024-05-13` as an exemplar agent to launch 4 concurrent `VAB-Minecraft` tasks.

### Overview on VAB Framework

To allow fast evaluation over agent tasks, we leverage AgentBench's framework as the backbone (currently for VAB-OmniGibson, VAB-Minecraft, and VAB-CSS).
If you are interested in its detailed implementation, please refer to AgentBench's [Framework Introduction](https://github.com/THUDM/AgentBench/blob/main/docs/Introduction_en.md) (which may not be necessary).
Basically, the framework calls all LLM/LMM in API formats via `Agent-Controller`, and accesses to environments via `Task-Controller`.
The `Assigner` will automatically assign evaluation tasks by pairing `Agent-Controller` and `Task-Controller` to optimize the overall evaluation speed.
For more detailed configuration and launch methods, please check [Configuration Guide](docs/Config_en.md)
and [Program Entrance Guide](docs/Entrance_en.md).

### Step 1. Prerequisites for All Environments

Clone this repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd VisualAgentBench
conda create -n vab python=3.9
conda activate vab
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure that [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is properly installed.

```bash
docker ps
```

For specific environments, please refer to their additional prerequisites respectively.
For VAB-WebArena-Lite, it is based on [WebArena](https://github.com/webarena-x/webarena) with some modifications, so please read its individual setup carefully.

* [VAB-OmniGibson Setup](docs/detailed_setups/VAB-OmniGibson.md)
* [VAB-Minecraft Setup](docs/detailed_setups/VAB-Minecraft.md)
* VAB-Mobile: Ongoing
* [VAB-WebArena-Lite Setup](VAB-WebArena-Lite) (Separate installation and evaluation method)
* [VAB-CSS](docs/detailed_setups/VAB-CSS.md)

### Step 2. Configure the Agent

Fill in your OpenAI API Key at the correct location in `configs/agents/openai-chat.yaml`.

You can try using `python -m src.client.agent_test` to check if your agent is configured correctly.


### Step 3. Start the task server

Starting the task worker involves specific tasks. Manual starting might be cumbersome; hence, we provide an automated script.

The assumption for this step is that ports from 5000 to 5015 are available. For Mac OS system, you may want to follow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69955686/why-cant-i-run-the-project-on-port-5000) to free port 5000 to use.

```bash
python -m src.start_task -a
```

This will launch 4 task_workers for `VAB-Minecraft` tasks and automatically connect them to the controller on port 5000. **After executing this command, please allow approximately 1 minute for the task setup to complete.** If the terminal shows ".... 200 OK", you can open another terminal and follow step 4.

### Step 4. Start the assigner

This step is to actually start the tasks.

If everything is correctly configured so far, you can now initiate the task tests.

```bash
python -m src.assigner --auto-retry
```

### Next Steps

If you wish to launch more tasks or use other models, you can refer to the content in [Configuration Guide](docs/Config_en.md) and [Program Entrance Guide](docs/Entrance_en.md).

For instance, if you want to launch VAB-OmniGibson tasks, in step 3:

```bash
python -m src.start_task -a -s omnigibson 2
```

In step 4: 

```bash
python -m src.assigner --auto-retry --config configs/assignments/omnigibson.yaml
```

You can modify the config files to launch other tasks or change task concurrency.

## Dataset Summary

We offer two splits for each dataset: Testing and Training. Different from its predecessor [AgentBench](https://github.com/THUDM/AgentBench), VAB is accompanied with a trajectory training set for behavior cloning (BC) training, which allows development of more potent visual foundation agents with emerging open LMMs.

## Leaderboard

Here is the scores on test set results of VAB. All metrics are task Success Rate (SR). Noted that proprietary LMMs are tested with mere **Prompting**, and open LMMs are tested after **Multitask Finetuning** on VAB training set, as they usually fail to follow complicated agent task instructions.
